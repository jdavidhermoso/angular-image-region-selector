# ImageRegionSelectorLibrary

ImageRegionSelector is a library to add an Angular component for allowing 
users selecting a region of an image or just be informed of a selected region of an image.
It uses Fabric.js, so it uses HTML5 Canvas.

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.9.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project image-region-selector-library` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project image-region-selector-library`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project image-region-selector-library` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build image-region-selector-library` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build image-region-selector-library`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/image-region-selector-library` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test image-region-selector-library` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
